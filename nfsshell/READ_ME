Nfs shell provides user level access to an NFS server, over UDP or TCP,
supports source routing and "secure" (privileged port) mounts. Its a
useful tool to manually check (or show) security problems after a security
scanner has detected them.
 
The sources are in:
 
        ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/leendert/nfsshell.tar.gz

The shell is tested on the following systems:

	System V release 4 (386)
	SunOS 4.[123] (SPARC/SUN3)
	DEC Ultrix 4.[23] (DEC Station 5100)
	AIX 4.1
	Linux 2.0.33
	Linux Redhat 5 (1)

(1) The stock RedHat 5 distribution lacks /usr/include/rpc/key_prot*.
    You have to install this before compiling. I took mine from our
    Linux 2.0.27 machine.
